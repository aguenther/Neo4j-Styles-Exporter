Just a little hack which allows you to copy/paste the styles of the Neo4j Data Browser for Chrome or Firefox with Greasemonkey.

Go to Data Browser > View Mode > Style > Export/Import to get your profile JSON, replace it with something else or extend it with data from someone else's JSON.
Changing the profile data will make the page reload, since the system won't notice it otherwise.


Also, this script is currently limited to localhost.
